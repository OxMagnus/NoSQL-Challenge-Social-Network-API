# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description
-I implemented a Social Network API backend using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database among developers. This API serves as the foundation for a social network web application where users can share thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ posts, and manage friend lists.

-The backend is powered by Node.js, utilizing the Mongoose and Express.js frameworks. The entire application was developed from scratch using JavaScript exclusively.
